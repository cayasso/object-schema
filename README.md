[![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/object-schema.png)](http://badge.fury.io/js/object-schema)

# ObjectSchema

ObjectSchema is meant as a filter/schema for filtering, checking and validating javascript objects.

It can be used for more than just creating MongoDB schemas in node.js.

The idea is to use the same code to validate client side form data (soon).

You can learn how it works, by reading the examples.

### This is an early BETA version

As soon as the module has shown it's worth and stability on a live system, it will be marked as version >= 1.0.0.

Until then: Feel free to play around with it, learn from it.

### To install

	npm install object-schema
